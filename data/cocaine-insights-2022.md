The cocaine market presents a clear threat at global level.

Well-defined locations of production in South America

and large consumer markets in the Americas and Europe

lead to trafficking routes from a circumscribed origin to

specific, even if far-flung, destinations. While some parts of

the world play a crucial role as transit regions, the routes,

modalities and networks employed by criminal actors con -

tinue to evolve, diversify and become more efficient. The

increasingly globalized, interconnected, digitalized and

technologically sophisticated nature of society, as well as

a growing affluent demographic in some regions where

cocaine use has traditionally been low, can potentially

catalyse and accelerate the dynamism and expansion of

the market.

The series  Cocaine Insights , developed by UNODC in the

framework of the CRIMJUST programme and in coopera -

tion with partners and stakeholders at national, regional

and international levels, delivers the latest knowledge and

trends on issues related to cocaine markets in an accessible

and informative format.

Impact on law enforcement:

Fighting drug trafficking during a pandemic  15

Drug trafficking into, out and through

Brazil during COVID-19  21 Volume  45

# The onset of the global Covid-19 pandemic

caused tangible changes in both the dynam -

ics of drug trafficking into and through Brazil

and in the operations of Brazilian law enforce -

ment agencies, as well as how these two things impacted on

each other. Data on cannabis and cocaine seizures in Brazil

exhibit both similarities and differences across the two drugs

during the period of interest; while the differences likely

reflect distinct market dynamics (COVID-impact included),

the similarities more likely reflect external factors, such as

law enforcement activities, impacting the two drugs indis -

criminately. Some of the observed changes were transient;

others, representing intensifications of existing trends or

shifts towards existing patterns, have the potential to persist.

COVID-19 initially brought about short-term

disruptions of law enforcement activity within

Brazil

The impact of COVID-19 measures and the pandemic

itself on law enforcement activities varied across different

agencies and across states, with some reporting illness of

personnel, others noting disruptions in their operations, and

still others indicating that their activities were not affected

in any meaningful way. However, a short-lived disruption in

normal activities was a recurrent pattern, as in the case of the

Federal Road Police and, to some extent, the Federal Police.

COVID-related measures quickly created an

environment which facilitated drug interdic -

tion on roads

Following the initial short-lived disruptions in law enforce -

ment activities, a decrease in circulation of vehicles due to

lockdown measures liberated some patrol teams (who might

be otherwise occupied with traffic accidents) and enabled

Changes in number of seizures by Federal Road

Police in Brazil, 12 months post-COVID versus 12

months pre-COVID, by federal unit

them to dedicate more resources to drug interdiction. In

addition, as transit became lighter, it allowed police to arrive

faster for emergencies and assist in the apprehension of

suspects. Moreover, with reduced numbers of vehicles on

the road, instances of trafficking would be more likely to be

detected in any routine checks. Furthermore, a reallocation

of resources allowed the authorities to increase the presence

of the state in strategic points. These changes, which apply

to cannabis and cocaine indiscriminately, were corrobo -

rated by trends in the  number  of cases in which cocaine

and cannabis were seized by Federal Road Police, which

both increased sharply, and in parallel, despite the fact that

the total  quantity  of cocaine seized by the same agency

across Brazil–likely reflecting supply–declined slightly in

the second quarter of 2020, and followed a trend in stark

contrast with cannabis. The distinct trends in seizure quan -

tities likely reflect distinct dynamics in the cocaine and

cannabis market, but also reinforce the evidence that the

above changes related to law enforcement lie behind the

similarity in trends in  numbers  of seizure cases.

Note: Throughout this document, the beginning of the COVID

period is considered to be April 1, 2020.

Seizure of cocaine and cannabis herb on highways

by Federal Road Police in Brazil, by quarter, Q1

2019-Q1 2021

Source:  Polícia Rodoviária Federal , Brazil

Seizures by Federal Road Police increased in

number across  almost  the entire scale of

seizure sizes–with one important exception

The changed circumstances affecting interdiction on roads

together with the focusing of efforts by law enforcement

resulted in increased numbers of cannabis herb seizures of

all sizes, and of cocaine of almost all sizes, with the notable

exception of very large seizures of cocaine. Such large sei-

zures, which constitute a small but important minority of

cases, remained relatively stable in number or became even

rarer in the case of extremely large seizures, contrary to the

predominant increasing trend. Moreover, they declined

when measured in terms of total quantity seized (aggre-

gated over all of Brazil), likely reflecting general availability

across the country and determining the overall trend in the

quantity of cocaine seized by Federal Road Police.

The cannabis and cocaine markets were

impacted in very different ways

Seizure data suggest that significant changes in the dynamics

of drug markets, especially trafficking into and out of Brazil,

occurred around the onset of COVID-19. Starting from

the second quarter of 2020, cannabis availability expanded

progressively across Brazil, driven by flows from Paraguay, as

borne out by increased quantities, in addition to numbers,

of seizures. In contrast, cocaine seizures declined overall,

with a varied impact on cocaine flows across federal units. COCAINE  INSIGHTS 7

Opposite effects on cocaine flows visible

along east-west divide

Rising trends in seizures in the west, and declining trends

in the east, suggest that the supply of cocaine entering the

country was not hampered, and even increased, during

the first few months of the pandemic, while distribution

towards ports for onward trafficking was disrupted, result-

ing in declines in outgoing flows.

Restrictions on regular border crossings likely

triggered an increased use of clandestine

flights and led to a surge in cocaine flows into

western border states, possibly further

fuelled by COVID-related fluctuations in

cocaine supply in source countries.

An increased flow of cocaine into the western border states

shortly after the onset of COVID-19 seems to have been

enabled, at least in part, by traffickers increasingly resorting

to clandestine flights to transport cocaine into Brazil, likely

in order to compensate for disruptions in established land-

based or waterborne cross-border channels into Brazil or

Paraguay. Moreover, COVID-19 impacted market dynamics

in the source countries, notably Peru and the Plurinational

State of Bolivia, and also brought about difficulties in law

enforcement at multiple stages of the supply chain (includ -

ing eradication), resulting in higher cultivation levels in

2020 (coming on the back of already high levels in 2019),

but also temporary disruptions in the internal supply chains.

Thus it is possible that the end-product (cocaine hydrochlo -

ride) was not only produced in a greater quantity overall, but

also became available in a “rebound” surge, resulting in an

abrupt accumulation of cocaine to be distributed relatively

quickly from the source countries.

COVID-related measures brought about

difficulties for organized crime groups to

move imported cocaine internally towards

exit ports and areas of consumption

Internal trafficking routes in Brazil appear to involve a

certain degree of centralization, notably in the state of São

Paulo. COVID-related measures appear to have impacted

the internal consolidation, redistribution and management

of cocaine stocks within the country. The reported use of

small aircraft on flights within Brazil represents a departure

from the more usual modalities for internal trafficking and

may also reflect the difficulties encountered by organized

crime groups in moving cocaine within the country using

the more established modes of transportation. Volume  48

The flow of cannabis herb from Paraguay into

Brazil increased dramatically, likely as a

consequence of reduced eradication activi-

ties and difficulties in cross-border

collaboration

Data from the Brazilian Federal Police indicate a strong and

abrupt expansion, beginning in the second quarter of 2020,

of cannabis seizures at aggregate level. A similar picture also

emerges from data on seizures from federal highways by

Brazilian Road Police, showing increases in the quantity

as well as the number of cannabis seizures, together with

a larger size of seized shipments. Moreover, the increase in

seizures appears to have occurred in a “ripple effect”, with

the strongest increases registered first in the states of Mato

Grosso do Sul and Paraná (the only two states border-

ing Paraguay) and subsequently in the adjacent states São

Paulo and Goiás. These changes appear to be explained by

unusually high levels of cannabis production in Paraguay,

facilitated by difficulties in conducting cannabis eradica -

tion activities in collaboration with Brazilian forces, in the

context of COVID-19.

Diversification of maritime routes exiting

Brazil continued

In recent years, Brazilian DTOs have diversified the routes

and ports used for trafficking of cocaine through and out

of Brazil beyond the long-standing use of large ports, seek-

ing to exploit smaller ports on the northeastern and the

southern coast of Brazil, where there is less capacity for

inspection. The diversification had been observed before

the pandemic but became particularly prominent during

its course, and was especially visible in terms of the destina-

tion countries of cocaine trafficked from Brazilian ports. Volume  410

COVID-19 accelerated the ongoing evolution

of drug markets

The diversification of ports of departure for cocaine ship-

ments is one example of an existing tendency which may

have intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic. Beyond

this, novel, contactless methods of delivery of drugs to

consumers continued to proliferate, especially via social

media platforms. Moreover, the cocaine market, already

dominated by a handful of actors with a far-reaching pres-

ence, showed signs of gravitating even more towards fewer,

bigger players, as large criminal groups proved to be highly

resilient to the effects of the pandemic, due to a well-estab-

lished logistical infrastructure, and were able to continue or

resume their activities. Smaller groups, however, reportedly

faced bigger challenges to continue their operations.

# The COVID-19 pandemic impacted drug

trafficking affecting Brazil in different ways,

depending on the drug and the geographic

region. The cannabis market experienced a

boom, perceptible in a ripple effect emanating from the

shared border with Paraguay, and likely attributable to the

impact of COVID-19 in this country, in particular the

reduction of eradication activities in Paraguay and obstacles

to cross-border cooperation between Paraguay and Brazil.

The impact on the cocaine market was more nuanced,

with  increasing  flows into the western states bordering

the producer countries of Bolivia (Plurinational State of ),

Colombia and Peru – possibly linked to COVID-induced

disruptions in existing cross-border channels and conse -

quent shifts in modalities, as well as volatility in cocaine

supply chains in the producer countries – combined with

decreasing  transatlantic flows out of the seaports, in addi -

tion to likely difficulties in the internal consolidation,

redistribution and management of cocaine stocks within

the country. The increasing flows into the western states

appear to have been achieved at least in part by means of an

expansion in the use of clandestine flights. In parallel, law

enforcement agencies and their workforce were themselves

impacted in different ways; in particular the Federal Road

Police incurred an immediate but short-lived shock to its

operations, followed by a period in which restrictions and

reduced traffic created an environment which facilitated

its work and led to higher numbers of seizures.

The above happened in a context of ongoing efforts to

enhance and better integrate the work of law enforcement

agencies operating at federal and state levels, especially in

border states, as well as an ongoing observed diversifica -

tion of trafficking routes used by organized crime groups

in Brazil in an attempt to evade interdiction. Both of these

dynamics started before, and independently of, the onset

of COVID-19; the VIGIA programme 1 has continued to

be implemented and to expand since then.

Drug markets are complex, and their development is

intertwined with a variety of aspects related to logistics,

geography, legitimate trade, cross-border ties and knock-on

effects, socioeconomic realities with varying rural and urban

dimensions, and law enforcement strategies and resource

availability, in addition to demand for drugs. Most of these

aspects do not usually change quickly; however COVID-

significant changes in cannabis and cocaine trafficking into

and through Brazil. These changes included disruptions of

established channels, which however appear to have been

short-lived, as well as shifts towards, and increases in, the

use of certain modalities, which have the potential to persist

and to grow; in both cases these developments demonstrate

the resilience and quick capacity of adaptation of drug

markets and drug trafficking organizations. The pandemic

illustrated the complex interplay of numerous factors and

underscored the necessity to respond with a coordinated,

measured, variegated and surgical approach, which can be

progressively tailored as necessary as its impact unfolds,

rather than any one-dimensional, blanket approaches.

In certain areas of intervention (such as illicit crop eradi -

cation), the activities of law enforcement have developed

gradually and incrementally to exert regular, continued

pressure on criminal organizations and thus successfully

restrain their activities (such as illicit crop cultivation).

When the activities of law enforcement are disrupted due

to unforeseen impediments or resource demands, this can

lead to consequential effects on the drug supply chain.

Avoiding law enforcement disruptions that can benefit drug

trafficking requires contingency planning, with a view to

achieving sustainability and resilience in law enforcement

operations.

Tight controls and regulations, or restrictions, on the legiti -

mate flow of goods and people do hinder drug trafficking

and can facilitate the work of law enforcement agencies.

However, increased law enforcement activity does not nec -

essarily translate into reduced supply, and stricter controls

can push criminals to avoid typical modes of transportation

in favour of entirely clandestine modalities to transport

drugs. In the case of cross-border flows into Brazil this

seems to have translated into an increased use of clandestine

flights; in the case of cross-border flows out of Brazil, or

into Europe, this could potentially translate into the use

of submarines or clandestine flights.

Border control remains a critical area to counter drug

trafficking, especially for countries with extensive borders

flanked by remote areas. Clandestine flights in particular

are especially attractive for criminals because they enable

the fast movement of large loads while circumventing

regulations altogether. Recent examples of successful

investigations and interdiction efforts by law enforcement

agencies in Brazil have shown that dedicated efforts and

investments in technology to counter the use of clandestine

flights can be effective in addressing drug trafficking. Like

all types of organized crime flows, large-scale trafficking

of drugs requires coordination and logistical organization;

if these activities can be targeted and impaired, they can

become the Achilles’ heel in the drug supply chain.

# Conclusions and Policy Implications Volume  412

Seizure data can provide insights into both the impact of

law enforcement and the dynamics of drug markets, but

their usefulness is greatly enhanced if they are collected

and consolidated in a systematic, comprehensive, case-by-

case fashion and analyzed in depth across time, space and

drug types. The value of these data would be even higher

if they could be triangulated with other market indicators,

including prices and purities, but also demand-side indica -

tors, collected with equal coverage and systematicity. This

warrants investment to strengthen data collection and data

consolidation practices, including coordination needed in

a federated structure such as in Brazil. COCAINE INSIGHTS 13

# When the COVID-19 pandemic began

spreading across the world in March 2020,

it impacted not only legitimate activities

but also the illicit ones. Effects of the pan -

demic on organized crime may be distinguished into direct

(i.e., pertaining to the lockdown measures or infections, and

the repercussions on the opportunity to commit crimes)

and indirect (related to the resulting economic downturn,

for example). Previous research finds that despite disrupting

some illicit activities, the pandemic has created numerous

opportunities for organized crime groups (OCGs) in terms

of bolstering their illegal governance, opening new illicit

markets, and creating avenues to infiltrate legal economies. 2,3,4

As the logistics of producing, trafficking and distributing

drugs rely heavily on the movement of people and licit

goods, the drug supply chain has been inevitably affected by

the pandemic-related measures introduced by governments

to limit the spread of the virus. 5 Among the factors that may

have caused a direct impact on drug markets during the

pandemic are disruptions in the flows of goods and people,

as well as changes in law enforcement activities. Analysing

drug trafficking in the context of COVID-19 may shed

light on the internal workings of the drug supply chain.

In recent years, Brazil has become an important gateway

for cocaine destined to Europe or Africa for further tran -

shipment to Europe. 6 The retail market for cocaine in

the country also appears to be the largest one in South

America. 7 In addition, during 2019-2020, two major

developments might have affected trafficking of cocaine

through Brazil: the already mentioned pandemic with its

social distancing measures and border closures; and the

implementation of new law enforcement strategies through

the VIGIA programme. 8 This research looks at the dynamics

# Introduction Volume  414

## Research methods

This study draws on extensive data collection

carried out by the UNODC Centre of Excellence

for Illicit Drug Supply Reduction 9 from official

agencies of Brazil that work at the national and

state level. It relies on official data on drug sei -

zures as well as on field research in the states

of São Paulo, Paraná, and Mato Grosso do

Sul. The research team conducted a total of

21 semi-structured interviews and 7 focus

groups with public agencies that act directly

in the fight against trafficking of substances.

The information obtained through interviews

and the focus groups have some limitations; in

particular, they do not represent the view of the

respective organizations and do not necessarily

cover the entire national territory. The qualita -

tive and quantitative information obtained were

used in a complementary fashion to explain the

changes that occurred in the local drug traffick -

ing scenario.

It is also important to emphasize that the

extent to which the quantitative datasets

obtained from different sources overlap is

unknown. The Federal Police are responsible

for the official drug seizure data commonly dis -

seminated in Brazil, which aggregate most of

the seizures from agencies at the federal level.

The data from the Federal Road Police have

the analytically useful characteristic that the

information recorded on a case-by-case basis

included exact dates and geospatial informa -

tion, allowing a more in-depth analysis where

appropriate.

Additionally, the study relies on responses to

the Annual Report Questionnaire by Brazil and

neighbouring countries, quantitative data from

other official national and international bodies,

and information available to UNODC through

its illicit crop monitoring programme. Finally,

these data are complemented by research

reports and scholarly articles on the issue of

cocaine trafficking in Brazil. Media sources

have also been considered when providing

additional details to facts established through

more robust sources.

# Impact on law enforcement:

# Fighting drug trafficking during a pandemic

# In late March 2020, the government of Brazil intro -

duced social distancing measures in most states,

restricted land travel between states and imposed a

temporary ban on foreign air travel to prevent the

spread of COVID-19. 10  The impact of these measures and

the pandemic itself varied across states and across different

law enforcement agencies, with some reporting illness of

personnel, others noting disruptions in their operations,

and still others claiming that their activities were not

affected in any meaningful way.

The most immediate impact of COVID-related measures

could be seen in changes in law enforcement officials’

personal life, which in some cases led to adjustments in

their professional routine. As one interviewed port official

explained, due to closures of schools, he had to modify his

schedule to be able to stay at home with his child while his

wife was at work. As a result, he was present at the port

during unusual hours which allowed him to take “a new

look” at the port dynamics. 11

More importantly, officials point out that some of their

colleagues fell ill or died because of COVID-19, which

resulted in shortages of personnel and a significant increase

in workload. 12  For example, some interviewees reported a

reduction in the capacity of their institutions. 13 ,14  In this

sense, the health crisis exposed weaknesses related to staff -

ing of some agencies, where many employees were in a

high-risk group due to their age. 15

In terms of law enforcement operations, the pandemic

seems to have temporarily disrupted some routine activities

16

and negatively impacted the effectiveness of the interdiction

efforts, especially in the early stages of the health crisis. For

example, according to one interviewee, pandemic-related

measures led to delays in training of drug-sniffing dogs that

took place in a city away from the port. As a result, new

dogs did not arrive at the port on time. 16

The Federal Road Police also experienced some interrup -

tions of routine vehicle inspections shortly after the onset

of COVID-19. 17  This effect was however relatively short-

lived (Fig. 1). 18  In the case of the Federal Police, some

investigative activities involving face-to-face interaction on

the street were also affected during the beginning of the

COVID-19 pandemic. 19

Not all types of law enforcement activity appear to have

been affected in the same way. Federal Police units in charge

of interdiction at the airports did not perceive major dis -

ruptions in their work because they were not charged with

additional functions, such as monitoring COVID-related

restrictions. 20  At the same time, other law enforcement

activities, such as ongoing investigations and data analysis,

were conducted remotely, when possible. 21 ,22

In some cases, the pandemic appears to have facilitated

drug interdiction. For example, data from the Federal Road

Police suggest that, due to lockdown measures, the volume

of vehicles on federal highways fell abruptly by about one

half in late March 2020, driven to a large extent by a sharp

drop in the circulation of light vehicles (although circula -

tion of heavy vehicles also exhibited a clear decline) and

returned to the previous levels only gradually (throughout

2020); 23  this decrease liberated some patrol teams (who

might be otherwise occupied by traffic accidents) and

enabled them to dedicate more resources to drug interdic -

tion. In addition, as transit became lighter, it allowed police

to arrive faster for emergencies and assist in apprehension of

suspects through intelligence work. 24 ,25  In some cases, night

patrols increased in order to curb crimes such as burglaries

and looting. 26  Moreover, with reduced numbers of vehicles

on the road, instances of trafficking would be more likely

to be detected in any routine checks.

Data from the Federal Road Police suggest that interdic -

tion on highways was facilitated following the onset of

COVID-19. Indeed, the number of instances in which

cocaine and cannabis were seized on Brazilian federal

highways increased sharply in both cases, and in parallel,

as of the second quarter of 2020, despite the fact that

the total quantity of cocaine seized generally followed

a relatively stable trend, in stark contrast with cannabis

(Fig. 2), and even registered a slight decline in the second

quarter – likely reflecting the availability of cocaine more

than law enforcement efficacy.

The rates at which the number of seizures of cannabis and

of cocaine increased were remarkably similar, even when

the instances are categorized according to the quantity

seized – with the important exception of very large sei -

zures (Fig. 3). These common trends likely reflect law

enforcement activity in the new context shaped by the

pandemic and appear to be to a large degree independent

of the actual developments in supply and market dynamics,

given that these presented stark differences between cocaine

and cannabis, as shown by the total quantities seized and

as discussed in later sections.

Thus, these trends suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic

created circumstances which were conducive to certain

types of interdiction–at least interdiction on roads. This is

reinforced by the fact that the increases in federal highway

seizures were almost ubiquitous across the federal units of

Brazil: 25 out of 27 federal units recorded an increase in can -

nabis herb seizures in the 12 months following the onset of

COVID-19 (compared with the previous 12 months), and

a similar pattern holds for cocaine (22 out of 27). Despite

this, several states recorded declines in the total quantity

of cannabis (9 out of 27) and cocaine (17 out of 27) seized

(Figs. 4,5).

The implementation of the VIGIA programme in 15 Brazil -

ian states also brought an intensification of law enforcement

efforts and may have resulted in increased interdiction, espe -

cially in terms of the number of operations and seizures. 27

However, the implementation of the VIGIA programme

started prior to the pandemic, developed progressively and

continued into 2021, while the number of seizures began

to increase rather abruptly around the time of the onset

of COVID-19 and then declined in the fourth quarter of

2020 and first quarter of 2021. On the other hand, the

VIGIA programme may have received a boost in terms of

funding due to a reallocation of resources shortly after the

onset of COVID-19. 28  It is unclear how long the impact

of this resource boost may have lasted; in any case, the fact

that the increasing number of seizures was nearly ubiquitous

across Brazilian states (including those where the VIGIA

programme has not yet been implemented), suggests that

the implementation of VIGIA does not fully explain the

increases in the frequency of interdiction, and that external

factors, such as reduced traffic, played a crucial role.

Seizure data suggest that significant changes in the dynamics

of drug markets, especially trafficking into and out of Brazil,

occurred around the onset of COVID-19 (Fig. 6). Seizure

data are however also influenced by law enforcement activi -

ties, which are themselves susceptible to impacts brought

about by shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This

analysis attempts to disentangle the two types of impact

– on drug supply and on law enforcement – in order to

elucidate changes in drug markets during this period. One

technique that will be used is to compare data for cannabis

herb and for cocaine, taking into account that certain type

of impacts on law enforcement are unlikely to differ across

the two types of drugs.

## Cannabis market

Data from the Brazilian Federal Police indicate a strong and

abrupt expansion of cannabis seizures at aggregate level (Fig.

6). A similar, and more detailed, picture also emerges from

data on seizures from highways by Federal Road Police.

Not only did the quantity of cannabis seized on highways

increase sharply, but also the number of instances in which

these quantities were seized; however, the growth in the

quantity outpaced the growth in the number of instances,

implying that in general seizures became on average larger

(Fig. 2). Moreover, the increase in seizures appears to have

occurred in a “ripple effect”, with the strongest increases

registered first in the states of Mato Grosso do Sul and

Paraná (the only two states bordering Paraguay) and subse -

quently in the adjacent states São Paulo and Goiás (Fig. 7).

It should be borne in mind that cannabis seizures in Brazil

follow a seasonal pattern, with a peak usually occurring in

the second or third quarter of the year (Fig. 8).

Although cannabis cultivation does occur in Brazil, notably

in the north and northeast, the majority of cannabis (spe -

cifically cannabis herb) in Brazil originates in Paraguay. 29 ,30

The seasonality of cannabis herb seizures likely reflects an

annual cycle in cultivation practices in Paraguay and pos -

sibly in eradication activities by law enforcement agencies,

and would suggest a prevalent practice in Paraguay of cul -

tivation of one main harvest per year.

Based on information from the  Secretaría Nacional Antidro -

gas  of Paraguay, provided to UNODC, cannabis cultivation

in Paraguay is mainly rainfed, and is thus subject to

annual climate patterns. Although the crop can be grown

throughout the year and lacks a fixed crop calendar, 31 ,32  as

of 2009 there was a main season starting in September-

October followed by harvests in January-February. This

period coincided with the cultivation of sesame and maize;

these crops and also pastures were used to hide the cannabis

plantations. If eradication took place, the farmer immedi -

ately replanted the site, which would become productive

in April-June. 33  Given the additional time it may also take

to process and transport cannabis herb, the above cycle is

consistent with a peak in supply of cannabis herb in Brazil

after the first quarter of the calendar year.

More recently, Paraguayan officials have indicated that

cannabis cultivation and harvesting in Paraguay depend

on the specific area, the conditions of the land and the

available technological and logistical resources. 34  They also

confirmed the period of October-February as the peak

period during the year, mainly due to the climate but also

such as carnival; the number of harvests may vary between 1

and 3 a year, 35  with 2 being the typical number. 36  Outdoor

cultivation is concentrated in departments such as San

Pedro, Concepción, Amambay, Caaguazú and Canindeyú,

especially the first three. 37  One interviewed Brazilian official

suggested that the peak harvest time may be around May or

June and also indicated that two crops a year are the norm. 38

Moreover, indoor cultivation of cannabis also occurs in

Paraguay in urban areas such as the city of Asunción as

well as the Central Department in general. 39

Independently of the dynamics driving the seasonality, it is

clear that the first few months after the onset of COVID-19

also coincided with the usual “surge” period in cannabis

herb seizures in Brazil. Nevertheless, the extremely high

seizures in the second and third quarter of 2020 were excep -

tional also in comparison with the same period in previous

years and cannot be attributed solely to the seasonal varia -

tion (Fig. 9).

According to interviewed officials, during the course of the

pandemic in 2020, cannabis eradication efforts in Paraguay

were reduced, 40  which could have resulted in the increase

in the available supply of cannabis. At the same time, the

efficiency of cannabis cultivation increased, with harvest

now possible more than twice per year. In relation to the

higher production, experts refer to a so-called “super har -

vest” of cannabis in 2020. 41  Paraguayan officials confirmed

the connection between increased seizures in Brazil and dif -

ficulties in Paraguay in carrying out eradication operations,

and linked the latter to the loss of funds usually derived

from the financial resources of the Brazilian Federal police

but reallocated in 2020 in the context of the COVID-19

pandemic. The collaboration of the Brazilian forces in the

eradication activities in Paraguay is of vital importance and

extends beyond financing to include support on logistics

and air transport, essential for entry into forested areas. 42

Brazilian interviewees noted that this type of cross-border

collaboration was especially hampered during this period.

Paraguayan officials also confirmed that weather conditions

in cannabis cultivation areas in Paraguay were optimal in

2020, but assessed that the impact of this particular aspect

on cannabis supply was marginal. Another hypothesis was

that the negative impact of COVID-19 on the informal

sector of the Paraguayan economy may have spurred work -

ers to move from urban to rural areas, where they could

engage in agricultural activities, including cannabis culti -

vation, taking advantage of food, shelter and security (in

addition to payment) provided by criminal organizations

managing cannabis cultivation. 43

Data on eradication activities from Paraguayan authorities

confirm the decline in eradication in 2020 and corrobo -

rate the hypothesis that this may have had an impact in

enabling a greater supply of cannabis herb. Total eradi -

cation of the cannabis crop in Paraguay ranged between

1,298 ha and 1,966 ha annually during 2014-2019, but

amounted to only 925 ha in 2020. 44  The decline was

mainly driven by significant shortfalls during the months

of February-June 2020, which in previous years accounted

(on average) for the highest levels during the year (Fig.

10). Cannabis herb seizures in Brazil, on the other hand,

may have been impacted with a delay of 2-3 months, as

during 2020 they first exceeded the historical average in

April (Figs. 11,12). The “deficit” in eradication in Para -

guay during February-June amounted to 756 ha; although

translating the impact of this area precisely into cannabis

herb production is not possible, the “excess” seizures of

cannabis herb in Brazil during the period April-August

(244 tons) appear to fall comfortably within the plausible

maximum, even taking into account that only a share of

production is actually seized. 45

It should also be noted that the pandemic roughly coincided

with the beginning of Operation Horus, 46  which led to an

increased presence of law enforcement on the border with

Paraguay, higher numbers of police officers on roads and

stepped-up police attention to large trucks transporting

big quantities of cannabis, and thus may have contributed

to higher seizures.

Another potential explanation for the high levels of of can -

nabis seizures, which emerges from some of the interviews

conducted for this study, 47  is that, when the border with

Paraguay was closed (in the beginning of the pandemic),

legal trade declined significantly, leading more people to

exploit illicit opportunities (such as drug trafficking) for

income.

## Cocaine market

Overall seizures of cocaine in Brazil declined sharply follow -

ing the onset of COVID-19. However, this trend appears

to be the net result of various dynamics affecting different

regions of the country, and also different types of seizures, in

different, and sometimes divergent, ways. Indeed, divergent

trends were observed both across different types of seizures

as well as in geographic terms. Moreover, these trends may

also be influenced by changes in law enforcement activity,

itself potentially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic,

and this needs to be taken into account in the interpretation.

The general trend in cocaine seizures in Brazil has for years

been driven to a large extent by quantities seized at seaports,

and this applies in particular to the recent decline (Fig.

13). These quantities reflect cocaine flows exiting Brazil

to destinations such as Europe and Africa, but could, in

of themselves, also be impacted by numerous other fac -

tors, such as the efficacy of law enforcement in detecting

and interdicting such consignments as well the efficacy of

criminals in evading law enforcement measures, including

through diversifying the ports used.

However, consolidated data on cocaine seized in destina -

tion countries, having departed from Brazil, reveal a similar

decline around the period of interest. This makes it less likely

that the changes were driven by less successful interdiction

and more likely that they reflect declines in actual flows of

cocaine out of Brazil.

For example, based on data from customs authorities in

Europe, even as total seizures in countries reporting to

the World Customs Organization Regional Intelligence

Liaison Office for Western Europe increased in 2020, the

seized quantity arriving from Brazil declined (Fig. 15).

Data from the UNODC Drugs Monitoring Platform,

> 46 Ministério da Justiça e Segurança Pública , “Operação Hórus: Ministério da
> Justiça e Segurança Pública fortalece combate ao contrabando na região
> de fronteira,” July 15, 2019. Available at: https://www.justica.gov.br/news/

with a more diverse coverage of destination countries,

also corroborate the decline, with seizures falling in line

with the drop at seaports in Brazil itself in the six-month

period immediately following the onset of COVID-19

in Brazil, but also suggest that the drop was transitory,

returning to the pre-COVID trend already in the follow -

ing six-month period (Fig. 14).

These data, when taken together, suggest that indeed the

flow of cocaine out of Brazil via large maritime shipments

was disrupted following the onset of COVID-19. However,

it cannot be entirely ruled out that changes in modalities

and routes used by traffickers (whether as a reaction to the

circumstances brought about by COVID-19 or even as a

continuation of independent ongoing efforts to diversify

and evade the attention of law enforcement), coupled with

challenges to law enforcement activity, may have led to a

decreased efficacy in interdiction within Brazil as well as

intelligence gathering and sharing with foreign counterparts.

The latter interpretation however is rather unlikely, also in

view of the fact that, with respect to other types of interdic -

tion, such as seizures on federal highways, the efficacy of

law enforcement during the period of interest appears to

have been enhanced, rather than hampered (as discussed

in the previous section).

Despite the temporary disruptions, interviewed experts

agreed that large criminal groups proved to be highly resil -

ient to the effects of the pandemic due to a well-established

logistical infrastructure and were able to continue or resume

their activities. Smaller groups, however, reportedly faced

bigger challenges to continue their operations. COCAINE  INSIGHTS 27

The declining trend observed in seaport seizures is not rep -

resentative of cocaine seizures in Brazil across the board.

Indeed, it appears that a distinction can be drawn between

large-scale and small-scale seizures. Case-by-case data

on seizures by Federal Road Police on federal highways

indicate a clear divergence in the trends followed by the

total quantities seized in large consignments (in excess of

200kg) and in smaller consignments (Fig. 16). Similarly,

separating the quantities seized by Federal Police into

seaport seizures (which tend to be among the largest)

and the remainder suggests that a similar pattern holds

for these seizures as well. 48

While the number of seizures made on highways by Fed -

eral Road Police increased,–reflecting a greater efficacy of

road police in interdiction – these seizures did not translate

into an increase in the overall quantities seized; instead,

the average size of each seizure decreased (Fig. 17, left).

28

More precisely, the number of seizures on federal highways

actually increased over almost the entire scale of seizure

sizes – from extremely small to the relatively large – with

the important exception of the largest seizures of all (Fig.

18, left). This exception was the crucial difference in com -

parison with seizures of cannabis herb, which registered

increases even through to the categories of seizures in excess

of 1 ton (Fig. 18, right). An increase in quantities of cocaine

seized can only be observed if the largest seizures are dis -

counted (Fig. 17, right).

Thus, it appears that the increasing numbers of cocaine

seizures reflect increased law enforcement activity or suc -

cess rates in interdiction, and the increasing total quantities

seized in the smaller categories of consignments are quite

likely a consequence of this. These increases do not neces -

sarily reflect increased supply and are in fact compatible

with an overall decline suggested by seizure totals recorded

by Federal Police.

There were also important regional differences in the dynam -

ics of cocaine markets during the period of interest. Indeed,

the onset of COVID-19 yields a picture of states register -

ing increases as well as decreases, with an east-west divide

corresponding roughly to increases in the western states

sharing a border with one of the source countries of Bolivia

(Plurinational State of ), Colombia and Peru and decreases

in the rest of the country (with some exceptions), especially

the states with access to the Atlantic Ocean.

However, in some regions, the declines seen in the aftermath

of the onset of COVID-19 appear to have started  prior  to the

period of interest, and thus were likely triggered by dynam -

ics entirely separate from the consequences of COVID-19

– even if the pandemic may have reinforced these trends.

Such dynamics need to be recognized in particular in the

two neighbouring states of São Paulo and Paraná. São

Paulo has long accounted for the largest quantities of seized

cocaine among the 27 Brazilian federal units, and Paraná

also became very important (in second place) in recent

years. In 2019, these two states collectively accounted for

58 per cent of total cocaine seizures recorded by Federal

Police (including seizures in the respective ports of Santos

and Paranaguá). Paraná shares a border with Paraguay, while

São Paulo is also within range of clandestine flights from

Paraguay and may thus receive cocaine directly from this

country. 49  São Paulo is also the heartland of the organized

crime group  Primeiro Comando da Capital  (PCC), 50  which

operates also in many other parts of Brazil (notably Paraná

and neighbouring Mato Grosso do Sul) 51  as well countries

upstream in the cocaine supply chain, such as Paraguay, 52

and in addition maintains extensive ties to counterparts

in destination countries. Brazilian authorities assessed

that, as of 2019, the PCC dominated many of the inter -

national cocaine trafficking routes from Brazil to Europe

and Africa. 53  A mapping of trafficking routes by Brazilian

authorities, including routes within Brazil, suggests that São

Paulo acts as a distribution hub for cocaine coming in from

the western border states and being redirected towards the

ports, including the relatively distant ports in the north -

eastern parts of the country. 54 ,55

Cocaine seizures in the three contiguous states of São Paulo,

Paraná and Minas Gerais peaked around the middle of

2019 –  before  the onset of COVID-19. Thus, the declines

in these states seen after the onset of COVID-19 may have

been, to some extent, a continuation of ongoing trends

rather than a consequence of COVID-19. In the period

prior to the onset of COVID-19, this declining trend was

also mirrored in the adjacent state of Mato Grosso do Sul,

bordering Paraguay and the Plurinational State of Bolivia

and likely also a major point of entry into Brazil, itself

feeding flows into São Paulo and Paraná; seizures in Mato

Grosso do Sul fell steadily every quarter between the first

quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. Finally, in

the period immediately preceding the onset of COVID-19,

declines were also registered, albeit in more erratic fashion,

in the neighbouring state of Mato Grosso.

One potential driver of these trends may have been a process

of diversification of trafficking routes chosen by crimi -

nals, away from the more established routes and ports and

towards alternatives in Brazil, possibly by way of reaction

> Available at: https://www.cdebrasil.org.br/boletins/.

to improved law enforcement awareness and procedures in

the port of Santos in the state of São Paulo 56 ,57  and Parana -

guá in the state of Paraná. 58  This hypothesis appears to be

corroborated by the fact that, comparing the consecutive

six-month periods of April-September 2019 and October

2019-March 2020, significant declines in several states –

mainly in the six contiguous states of Paraná, Mato Grosso

do Sul, São Paulo, Goiás, Minas Gerais and Mato Grosso

– were largely offset by increasing seizures in states with a

less “established” role in cocaine trafficking, most notably

Bahia and Santa Catarina (Figs. 21, 22). Brazilian authori -

ties highlighted large seizures in locations such as the Port

of Pecém and the Port of Vila do Conde as an illustration

of the diversification of the use of existing port infrastruc -

ture, to avoid better control and surveillance capacity in

southern Brazil.  59

## Diversification of cocaine trafficking through Brazilian ports

São Paulo, one of the states hardest hit by the

pandemic, 60  is home to the largest Latin American

container port, Santos, responsible for handling of

over 40 per cent of Brazil’s containers. 61  From there,

the bulk of cocaine is shipped to Europe and Africa.

Over 2015-19, the port of Santos saw a dramatic

increase in seizures of cocaine.

Drug trafficking routes, including maritime routes,

often shift over time in response to interdiction

efforts. In recent years, DTOs sought to use smaller

north-eastern and southern ports of Brazil, where

there is less capacity for inspection, such as Sao

Sebastiao, Vila do Conde, 62  and Ilheus. 63  The diver -

from Brazil had been observed before the pandemic

but became especially prominent during its course.

The diversification was also visible in terms of the

destination of cocaine trafficked from Brazilian

ports; the number of known destination countries

identified from seizures in Brazilian ports grew from

7 in 2018 to 20 in 2019 and 21 in 2020. The main

destinations for the drug in 2019 and 2020 were

Belgium and Netherlands, followed by Spain. 64  This

was confirmed by some interviewed officials, who

also noted that destination ports also shift over time.

For example, Italy was an important destination sev -

eral years ago, while nowadays, Antwerp (Belgium),

Rotterdam (Netherlands) and the Spanish ports of

Valencia, Las Palmas and Algeciras are frequently

used. 65  France, Nigeria (in 2019), Germany and Italy

(in 2020) also featured among the top 5 destination

countries (in terms of quantities seized in Brazilian

ports). 66

On the other hand, interviewed Brazilian customs

officials noted that due to the acquired experience

in identifying contaminated containers, different

customs agencies often transfer personnel to other

ports to facilitate the sharing of expertise and use

of technology. Thus, for example, an increase in

quantities of cocaine seized in the port of Salvador,

in the northeast of Brazil, during 2019 and 2020 may

reflect an improvement in interdiction efforts rather

than the spread of trafficking routes to smaller

ports. 67  Similarly, fluctuations in cocaine seizures

in the port of Santos itself may be indicative of

both heightened controls by law enforcement and

an increase in the use of the port by traffickers.

According to interviewed officials, in 2012 and 2013,

Federal Police were conducting active operations

in the port and seizures increased, while in 2015,

there was a decrease in quantities seized. In 2016,

quantities of cocaine seized started increasing again

due to a general increase in the supply of cocaine,

which in turn prompted customs to direct more

resources to drug interdiction. 68

Aside from changes purely within Brazil, given that cocaine

reaches São Paulo and Paraná mainly from the Plurinational

State of Bolivia and Paraguay, alternative routes could also

potentially include a “diversion” avoiding Brazil altogether,

whereby some of the cocaine supply in the Plurinational

State of Bolivia or Paraguay is trafficked southward to

reach the Atlantic through the River Plate estuary (close

to Buenos Aires, Argentina and Montevideo, Uruguay).

This route uses a combination of clandestine flights and

waterborne trafficking along the Paraná-Paraguay waterway;

the exploitation of this channel has expanded recently. 69

In any case, in order to understand the trends in the cocaine

market in the period of interest and the potential impact

of COVID-19, it is helpful to take into account the trend

prior to the onset of COVID-19 and to distinguish between

the various regions.

A more refined analysis which takes into account the trend

prior to COVID-19 confirms and crystallizes the general

pattern of an “upturn” in the western states bordering

the source countries of Bolivia (Plurinational State of ),

Colombia and Peru, and a “downturn” in most other states

(Fig. 23). In the case of the border states of Mato Grosso

and Mato Grosso do Sul, it appears that the most signifi -

cant changes occurring right after the onset of COVID-19

were a reversal of the previously declining trend. In the case

of São Paulo, Paraná and Minas Gerais, the “downturn”

appears to have accelerated an already declining trend, while

the general effect on other federal units (mainly those with

access to the Atlantic Ocean) appears to have been to reverse

the previously increasing trend (Fig. 21).

Data from Federal Road Police on seizures made on high -

ways also show a clear geographic divergence, within Brazil,

in cocaine seizure trends (Fig. 25). In the five states bor -

dering the source countries of Bolivia (Plurinational State

of ), Colombia and Peru (taken as a whole), total quantities

seized by the Federal Road Police increased (very much in

line with the figures recorded by Federal Police, Fig. 24),

driven in part by an abrupt increase in the average size of

seizures in the first quarter after the onset of COVID-19,

in addition to an increase in the number of seizures in the

following quarter. The increases were most clearly visible

in Mato Grosso (Figs. 26, 27). On the other hand, in

the states with access to the Atlantic, the average size of

cocaine seizures fell abruptly in parallel with an increase

in the number of seizures, resulting in a relatively stable

quantity seized (Fig. 25).

Together with the previously discussed evidence, these

patterns in seizure-based statistics strongly suggest clearly

divergent dynamics across Brazil in terms of the cocaine

market, specifically availability of cocaine in Brazil and

flows into and out of Brazil. It appears that states border -

ing the source countries of Bolivia (Plurinational State of ),

Colombia and Peru, notably Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso

do Sul, experienced a resurgence of incoming cocaine flows,

or at least a change of trafficking modalities which made

larger seizures more likely. It is possible, for example, that

cross-border restrictions on freedom of movement or dis -

ruptions in legitimate trade created difficulties for some of

the established trafficking channels from the Plurinational

State of Bolivia into Brazil or Paraguay, and thus rendered

clandestine flights into Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do

Sul a more viable alternative for traffickers. Land-based

trafficking in particular, which may have quite plausibly

been hit by restrictions on movement, is an established

modality for cocaine trafficking both into Brazil 70  as well

as across the Bolivia-Paraguay border. 71

One Brazilian interviewee described how the closure of

official points of entry at the land border triggered irreg -

ular border crossings for the purposes of trafficking. 72 ,73

Paraguayan officials, despite not having observed changes

in cross-border trafficking after the onset of COVID-19,

confirmed that trafficking by land into Paraguay includes

cocaine introduced through official checkpoints (in addi -

tion to irregular border crossings) and that cross-border

flows of private vehicles were impacted. 74  Moreover, restric -

tions in freedom of movement may also hinder the ability of

drug traffickers to meet their contacts in order to organize

and orchestrate shipments.

Officials of the Federal Police observed that traffickers

encountered difficulties in land-based trafficking by small

vehicles and resorted to small airplanes as an alternative. 75 ,76

An increase in the interception of small aircrafts entering

Brazil was registered. 77  This is corroborated by increases

observed in aircraft-related incidents reported by media

(Figs. 28,29), and may have been part of a broader pattern

affecting countries in the region, as an increase in the use

Clandestine flights departing mainly from the Plurinational

State of Bolivia and Paraguay are an established modality

for cross-border trafficking of cocaine in the region, includ -

ing into Brazil. 79 ,80  Already in their reporting on the 2019

reference year, Brazilian authorities indicated a widespread

use of stolen airplanes for drug trafficking, and noted that

air transport has a series of advantages for traffickers,,

such as swiftness, large load capacity and greater facility

to avoid monitoring. Small aircraft fly at low altitude, drop -

ping drugs or landing in clandestine airstrips or approved

highways. 81  According to Brazilian Federal Police, over the

period 2014 to August 2021, 65 per cent of incoming clan -

destine flights (carrying drugs) detected in Brazil originated

in the Plurinational State of Bolivia, followed by Paraguay

(17 per cent). 82  As noted by some interviewed experts, 83

such flights are clearly not affected by regulations restrict -

and can operate regardless of any COVID-related measures

introduced by authorities. Aircraft used include helicopters;

since 2018, nine such incidents were detected, of which

5 originated in Paraguay and most were headed to Paraná

or São Paulo (4 and 3 respectively). 84

It is relevant to point out that several states registering

increases in cocaine seizures, such as Mato Grosso and Mato

Grosso do Sul, were among 15 states where the VIGIA pro -

gramme was implemented; thus intensified law enforcement

efforts could in principle have contributed to the increases.

However, the implementation of the VIGIA programme

started prior to the pandemic and continued progressively

since then, while the increases in the western border states

began around the time of the onset of COVID-19 (in the

first semester of 2020) and were largely reversed by the first

quarter of 2021. For example, in Mato Grosso, the first

seizure attributed to the VIGIA programme was registered

in mid-2019, 85  while the increases in seizures on federal

highways occurred rather abruptly in the second and third

quarter of 2020 (Figs. 26, 27) and the quantity seized then

declined in the following two quarters (Fig. 26). Seizures

recorded by Federal Police followed a similar trend, with a

sharp increase in the third quarter of 2020 which was then

reversed by the first quarter of 2021.

While the injection of financial resources into the VIGIA

programme shortly following the onset of COVID-19 86

could go some way towards explaining this discrepancy,

there were several other states where the VIGIA programme

was implemented which experienced a  falling  trend in over -

all cocaine seizures around the time of the onset of the

pandemic (Fig. 23 in addition to Fig.19). These included

Paraná (where the VIGIA programme was initiated as a

pilot project in April 2019), Santa Catarina (where the

implementation of VIGIA began in April 2020 87  ) and

Rio Grande do Sul (where the implementation of VIGIA

began in July 2020 88 ). 89 ,90

Moreover, it is important to note that the increases in sei -

zures by Federal Road Police in the western border states

were driven by an abrupt change in the average size of

the seizures, in addition to a slightly delayed hike in the

number of seizures, in contrast with states with access to the

Atlantic Ocean (Fig.25). Indeed, a more detailed analysis

(Fig. 30) points to a certain gravitation of cocaine con -

signments seized in the western border states towards the

range of 400kg-550kg per seizure, and a roughly opposite

dynamic, accompanied with a general shift towards smaller

seizures, in the states with access to the Atlantic Ocean.

These shifts likely reflect changes in actual quantities of

trafficked cocaine and in trafficking modalities, rather than

changes in law enforcement activities.

The above, coupled with the evidence on increasing clandes -

tine flights as well as the relatively neat east-west separation

between “rising” and “falling” trends (Fig. 23), suggests

that law enforcement initiatives cannot be the primary

factor accounting for the increases in the western states,

which rather reflect to a large extent real changes in market

dynamics.

In contrast with the “upswing” in the western Brazilian

states bordering the source countries of Bolivia (Plurina -

tional State of ), Colombia or Peru, it appears that the

impact of COVID-19 in other parts of the country, includ -

ing the states with access to the Atlantic, was a reduction

in the availability of cocaine. One plausible explanation

for this is that restrictions on movement created difficulties

for organized groups to move cocaine within the country,

from the border areas to the points of exit. The logistics of

the cocaine supply chain within Brazil appear to involve a

process of centralization, consolidation, storage and redis -

tribution to the ports (Fig. 20); it is plausible that this

process, which normally relies to a large extent on land

transportation, was severely disrupted by restrictions on

movement. Brazilian authorities confirm that land trans -

portation, predominantly cargo trucks, is used (along with

air modalities) for internal distribution of cocaine and for

transportation towards seaports and airports, and also sug -

gest (as mentioned previously) that the state of São Paulo is

an important distribution hub in the network of internal

trafficking routes. 91 ,92

According to Brazilian officials, during the COVID-19

period, the use of small aircraft was observed not only to

introduce cocaine into Brazil, but also for internal move -

ments towards storage places or places of consumption. 93

The need to resort to such methods suggests that traffickers

indeed encountered serious difficulties to move cocaine

internally using the more usual conveyance by cargo trucks.

However, some interviewees were of the opinion that, as large

quantities of cocaine are typically hidden in legal goods, drug

trafficking across and from Brazil did not seem to be affected

significantly by restrictions on interstate and foreign travel. 94

A detailed analysis of seizures by Federal Road Police gives

more insight into the dichotomy between “incoming”

and “outgoing” cocaine flows. First, it confirms a general

shift towards less cocaine being seized, and a shift towards

cocaine being seized in smaller quantities, in the states with

access to the Atlantic, with an opposite tendency for more

cocaine being seized, and a shift towards cocaine being

seized in larger quantities, in the border states. Secondly,

it suggests that the diverging trends were driven to a large

extent by cocaine seized in consignments in the region of

400-550kg (Fig. 30).

It is notable that this range corresponds to the typical quan -

tity carried on clandestine flights, corresponding roughly

to the maximum load capacity of the small single-engined

aircraft that are typically used (Fig. 31). While seizures on

highways are clearly made from land vehicles, once cocaine

crosses the border into Brazil – whether via clandestine

flights or otherwise – it will typically be further relayed to

its next destination within Brazil via land transportation.

Thus, it is not to be excluded that the size of seizures on

federal highways also reflects the size of the consignments

in the previous step of the trafficking chain – including any

trafficked on clandestine flights into (or even within) Brazil.

Hence, these data provide further corroboration, albeit

indirectly, that the increases observed in Mato Grosso and

Mato Grosso do Sul may be linked to the use of clandestine

flights. The opposite dynamic may have occurred, in line

with the general declining trend, in other states, such as

São Paulo and Paraná.

In view of the fact that the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso

and Mato Grosso do Sul are adjacent to the Plurinational

State of Bolivia, it should be borne in mind that, in 2019

(prior to the pandemic) coca bush cultivation in the Plurina -

tional State of Bolivia had reached its highest levels (25,500

ha) since 2011, and rose by a further 15 per cent in 2020

(29,400 ha). This occurred in parallel with a sharp drop in

eradication activities, 95  which were suspended during April-

July 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions. Moreover, these

restrictions also led to the temporary closure of authorized

coca leaf markets. Furthermore, restrictions on mobility

between rural and urban areas were conducive to farmers

dedicating more efforts to cultivation and management

of their crops, thereby facilitating the production of coca

leaf itself. All of these factors led to a general accumulation

of coca leaf in the Plurinational State of Bolivia in 2020

and a drop in prices of coca leaf available in authorized

markets, which fell by 22 per cent between 2019 and 2020

(expressed in US dollar terms). 96

However, an increase in the availability of coca leaf does not

immediately and automatically translate into an elevated

supply of cocaine. According to Brazilian officials, due to

border closures in the beginning of the pandemic, traffick -

ers in countries where cocaine is produced (mainly in Peru

and the Plurinational State of Bolivia) had difficulties to

obtain precursor chemicals that they usually import from

Brazil to extract alkaloid from coca leaves. 97 ,98  According

to one interviewee, the effect was felt less in Colombia

because it has a more developed industrial infrastructure

from which precursor chemicals are diverted. The limited

supply of precursor chemicals initially created a situation

of oversupply of coca leaf in these countries. In the Pluri -

national State of Bolivia, the restrictions on circulation of

people also led to a drop in the number of potential buyers

of authorized coca leaf products, further compounding the

oversupply of coca leaf. Thus, when access to chemicals

returned, traffickers had a combination of oversupply of

cheap labour and low coca leaf prices, 99  possibly leading to

an abrupt rebound in the availability of cocaine.

It is unclear exactly at what point (if at all) during 2020

the COVID-related impacts on coca leaf production in the

Plurinational State of Bolivia translated into an increase

in cocaine availability in this country (and thus increased

supply for trafficking into the neighbouring Brazilian

states), but it should be borne in mind that such an increase

may already have occurred on the back of high levels of

cultivation in 2019. As some Brazilian experts note, during

the first months of the pandemic the supply was likely to

come from already available stashes of cocaine (stored in

Brazil or outside). 100

Another important factor to consider is that the supply of

cocaine within the Plurinational State of Bolivia is in part

fuelled by the production chain in Peru. Aside from cocaine

originating from coca bush cultivation in the Plurinational

State of Bolivia itself, Bolivian authorities assessed that, in

recent years, Peru was a major source country for cocaine

salts present on Bolivian territory. 101  It appears that some

of this cocaine is trafficked in the form of coca paste ( pasta

básica de cocaína ), via clandestine flights as well as land

trafficking routes, into the Plurinational State of Bolivia,

where it is processed into cocaine hydrochloride. 102 ,103

In Peru, coca leaf production for the illicit market in 2019

was already estimated at its highest level (121 tons) since

2011, and it increased by a further 12 per cent in 2020. 104

Moreover, with the advent of COVID-19, eradication of

coca bush fell by more than one half in 2020 105 ,106  and the

prices of coca leaf, coca paste and cocaine hydrochloride

all incurred sharp drops in April 2020, especially coca leaf

prices, which fell by 46 per cent in comparison with January

2020. 107  Similar to the developments in the Plurinational

State of Bolivia, this was likely indicative of an overabun -

dance of coca leaf as well as temporary disruptions in the

cocaine supply and processing chain, causing fluctuations

in cocaine availability which may have impacted the flow

of cocaine both into the Plurinational State of Bolivia or

even into Brazil directly. Peru shares a border with the Bra -

zilian states of Acre and Amazonas; however, the increases

in cocaine seizures in the first six months after the onset

of COVID-19 were distinctly more pronounced in the

Brazilian states sharing a border with the Plurinational State

of Bolivia. Based on estimates by Peruvian authorities, it

appears that the most important channel for cocaine exiting

Peru across its land borders consists of clandestine flights

to the Plurinational State of Bolivia; however, starting in

2018, Peruvian authorities observed a new trend of flights

headed towards Brazil. 108 ,109

Finally, it cannot be excluded that the difficulties generally

encountered by law enforcement agencies in the Plurina -

tional State of Bolivia and Peru in their activities (beyond

eradication of coca bush), especially in those activities tar -

geting the later stages of the cocaine supply chain, may have

contributed to a greater availability of cocaine in Peru and

the Plurinational State of Bolivia and a greater opportunity

for criminal groups to operate. According to one Brazilian

interviewee, law enforcement agencies in the main producer

countries experienced difficulties in carrying out police

operations in the beginning of the pandemic, as they had

to redirect resources to monitor lockdown measures. Aside

from eradication activities, lab dismantling operations also

had to be suspended. Reduced police counterdrug activity

in source countries might have led to an increase in the

supply of drugs. 110

Based on data from Peruvian authorities, significant

decreases were recorded in 2020 not only in terms of

eradication of coca bush, but also seizures of cocaine

hydrochloride (which declined by 28 per cent), seizures

of chemicals frequently used in the manufacture of drugs

(both those of under national control, which declined by

37 per cent, and those not under national control, which

declined by 68 per cent) and detections of maceration pits

(27 per cent), of coca paste laboratories (22 per cent) and

of clandestine airstrips (29 per cent). However, seizures of

coca paste actually increased by 26 per cent. 111 ,112

In the Plurinational State of Bolivia, year-on-year changes,

in 2020, in seizures of cocaine hydrochloride, cocaine base

and coca leaf were within 10 per cent of the 2019 levels;

however, the number of destroyed cocaine hydrochloride

(“crystallization”) laboratories fell from 50 in 2019 (includ -

ing 27 in the eastern department of Santa Cruz bordering

the Brazil) to 36 in 2020 (including 15 in Santa Cruz).

Similarly, the number of destroyed “recycling” laboratories

fell from 47 in 2019 (including 25 in Santa Cruz) to 37 in

2020 (including 16 in Santa Cruz). 113 ,114

Thus, it remains plausible that the dynamics of the cocaine

production chain or cocaine supply reduction within the

Plurinational State of Bolivia and Peru, themselves impacted

by COVID-19 in various ways, contributed to increased

flows into the neighbouring Brazilian border states, notably

Mato Grosso. However, in view of the fact that the routes

from and through the Plurinational State of Bolivia are

not new, the mere increase in the supply of cocaine within

this country does not fully explain the apparent shift away

from the southern state of Paraná (bordering Paraguay) and

adjacent São Paulo, and towards the more northerly state

of Mato Grosso. This shift is more likely attributable to

disruptions to cross-border land-based or fluvial channels,

including channels exploiting legitimate trade and chan -

nels into Paraguay in addition to Brazil, combined with

the presence of an alternative, already established chan -

nel consisting of clandestine flights into Brazil, departing

predominantly from the Plurinational State of Bolivia (in

addition to Paraguay).

The dynamics of the supply chain in Colombia in the

context of COVID-19 shared some commonalities with

the Plurinational State of Bolivia and Peru, mainly in that

mobility restrictions hindered some actors from reaching

coca growing regions in order to buy coca leaf, thus trig -

gering a drop in prices. In the context of Colombia, this

appears to have spurred some coca growers to take charge

of processing the coca leaf into coca paste themselves and

to subsequently attempt to find buyers in the nearby urban

centres; this situation was temporary and was gradually

reversed. However, drug supply reduction activities in

Colombia, such as eradication of coca bush and destruction

of laboratories, did not register drastic drops in results in

2020. At the same time, production of cocaine hydrochlo -

ride was estimated to have continued to increase in 2020,

due to ongoing dynamics independent of COVID-19. 115

In the Brazilian state of Amazonas, adjacent to Colombia,

seizures of cocaine registered by the Brazilian Federal Police

doubled in the 6 months following the onset of COVID-

19, from 308 kg in the period October 2019-March 2020

to 637kg in the period April-September 2020. 116

Retail markets in Brazil during the pandemic

At the level of distribution of drugs to consumers, several

emerging trends remained relevant throughout the analysed

period and may have been accelerated by the pandemic.

Interviewed experts agreed that retail selling of different

types of drugs adapted quickly to social distancing measures

by increasing the use of delivery services as well as drive-

through and internet-based distribution. These dynamics are

especially relevant for cocaine, which, due to its high price

relative to other drugs, in many countries has a significant

consumer base among the higher-income population with

increased access to and familiarity with the relevant platforms

– although Brazil in particular is also affected by extensive

consumption among less affluent population segments.

The use of delivery services may be reflected in an increase

in the number of seizures by Military Police of cocaine,

in base form, from motorcycles. 117  Likewise, interaction

between drug dealers and consumers is taking place increas -

ingly via social media platforms, such as WhatsApp groups,

Facebook, Instagram, and dating sites, where the drug is

typically sold at a higher price than on the street. 118

Some law enforcement officials perceived an increased con -

sumption of drugs during the pandemic. 119 ,120  Like with

wholesale drug trafficking, smaller groups on the retail

market had more difficulties to remain active. Some experts

point out the consolidation of retail drug distribution in

the hands of larger dealers; many of the smaller retail drug

points ( biqueiras ) went out of business. 121

## Some trafficking by air is substituted

## by sending small quantities by mail

Reportedly, Brazilian law enforcement officials noticed

a significant increase in cocaine seizures from the postal

service during the pandemic. Sending small quantities of

cocaine by mail might reflect an alternative way to export

drugs when commercial flights were restricted. 122  Not sur -

prisingly, seizures at airports declined significantly in 2020

(Fig. 32). Another explanation for an increase in seizures

from the postal stream, suggested by law enforcement, is

that the decrease in economic activity due to social dis -

tancing measures led more people to seek an alternative

income source by sending packages with drugs by mail.

Finally, an increased incidence of postal packages carrying

drugs may be linked to an increase in the use of digital

platforms such as darknet marketplaces, which often rely

on postal services as their method of delivery, or instant

messaging platforms. 123
